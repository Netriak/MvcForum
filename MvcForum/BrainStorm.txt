---------------- Permissions system:

Requirements:
- User groups of some sorts. One has to be able to add a user to an administrator group to give them full authority.
- One can be moderator of some forums, but not others.
- Said moderation rights are defined once, not twice.
- Said rights can be modified.
- There can be restrictions on registered/banned and various other things on a per forum basis.
- Again, said restrictions are defined once. Do not repeat yourself and all that.

Idea:
- There are two things:
	User groups and permission sets

	Users are members of one or more user groups. The everyone group includes everyone, therefore one or more.
	User groups do not have rights per se. Exception: the buildin administrator group?
	Permission sets define rights
	Possibly they can deny rights too. But that is a potential future point, and irrelevant for the initial design.
	The link that ties all together is a special link table containing the category, permission set and user group.
	The category part in said set is optional (nullable) the other two are mandatory.
	So permission sets can be attached to multiple categories and user groups.
	And user groups and categories can each have multiple permission sets.

	How to perform a permission check:
	'Grab' all link sets with a category that is the current category or one of its parents or null.
	Filter that set on user groups that the user is part of.
	Search the permission sets that are left for one that contains the required permission.
	If one is found: Allow
	Else: Deny

	Non-category specific permissions are saved in the role table. No need for an extra table for them.
